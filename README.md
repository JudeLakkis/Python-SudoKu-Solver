# Sudoku Solver
**Currently Under Development**

## Aims:
- [x] Read base case puzzle in from text file
- [ ] Display board before solution is implemented
- [ ] Back tracking algorithm that solves the base case puzzle
- [ ] Puzzle generator

### Side Note
This project has been created for two purposes:
1. Practice Python Coding
2. Learn the Back Tracking Algorithm

_There are plenty of solutions which are much more efficient out there. I'm just using this as a learning opportunity._
